# Game Testing Concepts  
## Official Bungie Video Halo 3
###### 'The Testing' Pt 1 & 2
_**1. After watching some of the testing activities required to test Halo, name two skills that are important for a tester to have?**_

Skill 1: I think that one of the most important skill for being a tester is to have team skills (being able to work with a group).

Skill 2: Another skill is to have the ability to think like a player, and instead of playing the way that the developers intended, and just 
and see what glitches can be found.

_**2. What do you think is hardest about being a tester based on watching the video?**_

I would guess the hardest part about being a tester is the amound of redundancy and frustration that this must bring. Also the fact that it 
can be a never ending cycle because when fixing one bug, it can potentially create many more bugs, that now you must try and find/fix.

_**3. What is something new you learned about being a tester? Or something you found interesting?**_

Something new I found was that even though you can know a map, a weapon, or anything on one machine and can play it without any problems,
somewhere else on a different machine, there can be something off (such as a gun playing perfect forever on machine 1, yet on machine 2 it
plays totally different).

Something interesting was when they were talking about how when the playtesters were getting frustrated, getting lost, dying frequently, 
were all being recorded for later use, and then in the meeting room, a map of all of this is recorded, where they can simply tick the icon
on the map and see the video of the actual player, doing the actual thing, and then go from there.
