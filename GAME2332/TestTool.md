# Test Tool Research

* Cucumber

The name of the test tool I found on the web is called "Cucumber". It has an MIT license and was developed by Aslak Helles√∏y,Joseph Wilk, 
Matt Wynne, Gregory Hnatiuk, Mike Sassa. One feature of Cucumber is that you can see specific function of the software with the "Use Case" 
feature. Another Feature is called Scenario is a flow of events that includes an executable test case. And one more feature is that tags will
help keep it organized, however, this tool does not do any test case storage nor does this tool allow testers to link requirements or defects
to test cases. Cucumber is an automated testing tool that is programmed using Ruby and can be used with Java.
