## Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege

Tom Clancyâ€™s Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person tactical shooter game developed by Ubisoft. The game can be fun, competitive, rewarding 
and addictive. There are three different game types to play. After playing R6 Siege, there are several functions that I think a tester would look at.

When the game first starts up, there are several different buttons on the home page (alpha packs, daily challenges, ubisoft club, etc.) that need to be tested to make sure they go to the correct areas. There are also several gaming modes with difficulty choices like multiplayer, terrorist hunt or situations. These should be tested to ensure they also go to the correct areas and are the correct chosen difficulty. Before the game starts, the option to pick a spawn point, character and weapon needs to checked. A test should be done for these as well. 

Once the game begins, looking around the starting area challenges more tests. A tester would probably look to see if they are able to go through things that they should'nt be able to like; rocks, walls, and even checking to see how far on the ledge to walk before falling off. When peering under barricaded doors and/or shooting at a target on the other side would be tested to see if the target gets hit, and  if the barricade breaks in the correct spot. There is alot of barbed wire in the game as well, that should be tested to make sure the player is slowed down, and the wire is moving and sounding off the right sound.

When shooting a weapon, the sounds should be checked to see if they're correct when shooting near and then far, and then hitting a target. The accuracy of the guns should be checked to see if they display a bullet hole on the wall or object that shows on the scope where it should be. The blood splatter after hitting a target should be tested to see if it goes where it might really go if hit at that angle. Finally, tests should be done to see ensure the points/damage that show on the screen display correctly at the final score. And once the game is over, if the character, weapon and map are all the same ones that were chosen for that match.

There are a ton more tests that would be done for a big game like this one. These are just a few of the initial funtions that a tester would need to look at when evaulating Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.
