## Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege

Tom Clancyâ€™s Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person tactical shooter game developed by Ubisoft. The game can be fun, competitive, rewarding 
and addictive. There are three different game types to play, terrorist hunt, multiplayer and situations. After playing R6 Siege, there are 
several functions that I believe a tester needs to look at.

Something interesting was when they were talking about how when the playtesters were getting frustrated, getting lost, dying frequently, 
were all being recorded for later use, and then in the meeting room, a map of all of this is recorded, where they can simply tick the icon
on the map and see the video of the actual player, doing the actual thing, and then go from there.
