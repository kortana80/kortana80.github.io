# Game Critique
## Minecraft

Minecraft is a sandbox video game created by a Swedish game developer but later developed by Mojang. The game allows players to build 
with a variety of different blocks in a 3D generated world. The game lets you be as creative as you want to be. It can be fun, rewarding
and surpisingly addicting. The game can be played in creative mode or in survival mode with different difficulty levels. After playing 
Minecraft on both creative and survivual mode, there are several functions that I think a tester would look at.

After choosing survival mode there is a multiplayer option. The first test I believe needs to be tested is the networking. To play 
multiplayer the network needs to work for both LAN and/or online to ensure that both players are able to connect and play with each other.
Once it is able to connect the players together in a room, the players need to be able to see each other and work together in the game for
the multiplayer option to function correctly. As far as the difficulty levels, that should be tested as well to make sure that if the player
chooses to play on easy that the game is actually easy and not too difficult. Or if the player chooses creative mode that zombies or other
mob don't come attacking.

After looting a fishing pole, the fishing function should be tested to make sure it works right. Once the player throws the fishing bob into
the water, the fishing begins after a swarm of bubbles find their way onto the bob to which the player must press a button to catch the fish.
It is not gauranteed to catch a fish everytime, as sometimes when repeating the same function that previously retrieved a fish, retrived
nothing instead. The test should ensure that at some point, probably even half the time, the fishing function should present a fish to the
player at least five out of ten times.

When crafting in Minecraft, there is a lot of tests that should be done. Laying out supplies on the crafting table and actually receiving
such item should be one test. There are many lay out patterns that produce different items, and the test should make sure that, that
particular item is the one being produced every single time when that certain pattern is laid out on the table. The tests here can help to 
ensure that the fuctions on the crafting table are producing the correct items that the player intends them to be.

There are a lot more tests that would be done for a game like this one. These are just a few of the initial funtions that a tester 
would need to look at when evaulating Minecraft.
