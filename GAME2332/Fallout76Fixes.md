## Fixes from the Fallout 76 Fallout:
| # |	Bug Description |	Type of Testing |	Steps used to Identify each bug |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | AFK (maybe notsomuchofa) Bug: Players disconnected from the server after 10 minutes of inactivity, with no warning issued beforehand. | Blackbox testing/Playtesting; It would probably be blackbox testing because whiteboxers would probably have some sort of thing on theirs that doesn't let get logged out so they can test. | Log in, don't move, see what happens when getting disconnected |			
| 2 | Art/Graphic Bug: Ambient Occlusion: Placed items leave behind shadow outlines after being picked up. | Whitebox/Functional Testing; This is something that they should have caught during whitebox testing if they would have payed a little more attention to details | Pick up item, check surroundings, see if everything looks good |			
| 3 | Enemy Bug: An issue in which some enemies could chase the player farther than intended. | Whitebox/Unit testing; Something that maybe should have been caught earlier in whitebox | Run from enemy, check to see how long it takes you before you are in the clear, make sure enemy stays in their area |	
| 4 | Repair Bug: An issue that could cause an item to return to a broken state after being repaired. | Blackbox/Unit testing; Probably blackbox because once the whiteboxers fix something and it repairs they probably move on directly afterwards without using that item again | Have broken item, repair item, use item, see how good it was repaired. |	
| 5 | User Interface [Social]: An issue that could cause players to disappear from each otherâ€™s social menus if two players each sent a friend invite to one another. | Whitebox/Functional Testing; I would think that this is another that should have been caught during white testing. I would think that when testing this function of sending friend invites to check to see what would happen if 2 friends sent to each other.  | Invite friend, have friend invite back, see if everything looks good.
