# Summary



 This game is about a twelve grade student named Max Caufield. Max Caufield discovers that she can rewind time when witnessing a girl getting shot, using this to her advantage she decides to change the future simply by changing her response to the situation at hand, it doesn't take long to understand the basics of the game you quickly realise the main theme of the game is rewinding time. The controls for the game are easy as well, from the hour of playtime, I gathered that Max Caufield is very anti social, however she is preceived as nosey from her fellow classmates. I also gathered that many of the choices you can possibly make influence the path of the story based game. Around 30 minutes of playtime, I found that each character has a different role, such as the bully, or the shy girl. This game revolves around paying close attention to your surroundings, the options that you make can be the cause of life or death for a vital character in the game. Getting closer to the end of each "episode" of the game, there are cliffhangers, leaving you to want to play more. 
 

# Final Thoughts

This was definitly an exciting game, but can be a little frustrating to find all the crucial parts in the story. I was only able to pay attention to certain things, I found that I would miss some parts to the game that I didnt notice, however, the cliffhangers to the end of each episode made me curious on what would happen next, I'm sure that I have missed some parts of the episodes, I will probably go back to try to find more of the possible choices. Life is strange recieved a 4.6/5 on common sense media, I can see myself casually playing the game a little more.
