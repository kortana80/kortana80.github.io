# Summary

This game is about an alien who suddenly appears in an open ocean. This alien scuba dives with infinite oxygen and explores the ocean 
teeming with lush plants and sealife. The colors are vibrant. The controls for the camera and swimming start off as inverted so they were 
hard to control  until I changed the settings to normal. From the 45 minutes of playtime, I gathered that the alien was "unkillable" and nothing 
could kill him or was even threatening towards him. (They're were small sharks but nonthreatening). I also gathered that the alien's only 
mission thus far is to find little areas where he can release different species of sealife, collect shells and rescue some robot looking 
things that follow him around. 20 minutes in, the game seemed to have no other purpose, the alien found a spot on a sunken statue where 
he could meditate and watch the sea creatures. There was options for him to even ride some of the bigger animals to view the serene 
surroundings of the ocean floor. During meditation, the game crashed (assumably from all the action of the sea going on at once). There 
seemed to be no direction and I was unsure of what I should be doing nearly the entire time I played. 35 minutes in, and I thought there was 
nothing to this game but to explore, but then I finally find a small cave opening and swim through it. Once passed this part, the ocean becomes much
deeper and darker while the music gets more anxious.

# Final Thoughts

This was definitly a relaxing, but a little frustrating, exploring game.  I was only able to explore it for a bit longer but the deeper/darker area
has intrigued me to find out what was up next. I am aware that I merely scratched the surface of this game, (most likely just played a 
tutorial on how to swim and collect things). Abzû recieved a 9/10 on Steam, so I think I may try to play it further just to satisfy 
my curiosity.
