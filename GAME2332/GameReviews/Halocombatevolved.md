The Pillar of Autumn, the ship the Master Chief is on, escapes by jumping into hyperspace and where they end up finding a giant ring aka "Halo".  The Covenant destroy the ship causing the survivors to land on the ring.

Soon, they learn that Halo is really a weapon that will destroy the part of the galaxy that the flood is in.  Your job in this game is to save the galaxy from both The Flood and Covenant to save Earth.

# Final Thoughts

This is a game I have actually played for a while. I have played it since the beginning. My very favorite Halo game was the PC version "Halo I". It's very addicting and fun to play with friends or even alone during campaign mode or multiplayer. I would consider Halo one of those games that, for me is definitly a must have.
