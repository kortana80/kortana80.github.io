# Summary

This game is a full on stealth game. You play as a goblin named Styx who's main objective is to reach the heart of the Elve's 
World-tree. The setting here is the usual castle, guard and  soldier theme. You start off in a dark area all by yourself (oh by the way, 
you are the only goblin, he states he is one of a kind. Everyone else is human or elf) and you must retrieve your dagger, here, the game
shows you how to jump and climb walls and things that you must do for the remainder of the game. I played the game in Normal Mode but there is a Goblin mode which is supposedly really hard. Normal mode, was just your average mode, you get spotted easily if your not hidden good enough, and when you fight, if feels like they have the leg up, but it becomes easier to win the more you try. In this game Styx must be very sneaky, stay in the shadows and keep hidden to get to his destination. Styx can peer through key-holes, pick locks, take cover, hide under or in various furniture, extinguish lanterns, kill in muffled mode to stay quiet, and hide their bodies. He has a giant tattoo on his body that glows whenever he is in the dark, which is helpful to know when he's hidden, however a few times, the guards have seen me even while my tattoo was glowing. When sneaking up on people to kill them, you must land on carpet for quietness and then strike from behind. Kill them regular if nobody is around or muffled to stay quiet then hide their bodies and turn off the lights. If somebody does see you, you have to fight, you get locked in the room with them and then you must either parry their attack or try to swing at them with your dagger. The first few times, it took some getting used to, to be able to parry them and go in for the kill. Apparently later on in the game, you have the option to clone yourself, become invisible, lure targets and use a vision to detect hidden areas or enimies. The game has an autosave feature which saves right before a battle, which I find is very helpful.


# Final Thoughts

When I came across this title, I had never even heard of it, but I found was a stealth game with good reviews, so I tried it. It was an 
easy game to get into, the controls are easy to use and everything is pretty self explanatary. This game did have a lot of cinematics, and I did notice some glitches, such as one of the guards robes when kind of haywire as he was walking away. The graphics are decent, definitly not as good as others but also not as bad as others.  I like stealth games, my favorite being Tom Clancys, Splinter Cell series and this one, for me, wasn't as good as that. It was a good game to try though but i'm not sure if I would play this game again.
