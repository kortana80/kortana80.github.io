# Summary

This game is about a scientist who has invented a re-spawn machine, and after another scientist wants to get his hands on it. He sends his minions to the inventors office to retrieve it, but the inventor has escaped out of a window an onto a roof. This is where the game begins. You play as the scientist/inventor and must run away from the minions at all costs to keep the respawn machine out of the wrong hands. The only way to get away is somehow getting over onto other building roofs. The problem is that you cannot jump that far and must use the invention by throwing it safetly onto another roof. The bad part is: you have kill yourself after doing that so that you can respawn onto that other roof where the invention is. Suicide comes easy, by jumping down into the street, being cut in half by helicopter propelors, lasers, running into the minions etc. The rest of the game played thus far was using the respawning gun, commiting suicide and facing other dangers to keep on getting to safe locations and away from the minions. 

# Final Thoughts

At first I didn't know what I was supposed to do. I kept falling off the building and dying when trying to jump onto the other roof. But after figuring out that the invention must be thrown over, and then you must die before respawning to it, it gets a little better. After getting used to the controls, it gets funner the further you play but it is a little repetitive: (jump across buildings, kill yourself, jump across building, kill yourself); and at some parts it was a little glitchy: (getting stuck between objects, falling through floors). This game definitly is a very good start for a first game, and it is not bad game to try and play.
