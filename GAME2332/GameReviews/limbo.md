# Summary

This game is a puzzle-platform/side-scroller game. You play as a, what looks to be, a shadowy little boy with glowing eyes. The entire game is black and white and simple, so simple, there is not one single letter or number on the screen so you can just figure out how to play by yourself. This makes the game very intriging and keeps your interest. The setting is a dark area with dead trees and everything which is out to kill you. When you first start the game, you awake from the ground and stand up with your eyes glowing, which indicated your alive.  The first initial part of the game is you learning how to move, jump, climb, push, pull, etc. After you know how to do things, the game gets serious and slowly introduces you to dangers. It also likes to kill you in gruesome ways, which is always a good idea. Some of the things that kill you are bear traps, spikes, big rocks, spiders, drowning, machinery and other shadowy little boys. 

For some reason the only other people in this game are all small shadowy little boys, and they are all out to kill you. There are not many, but they still want you dead. There are more of those shadowy little boys dead than alive. This game is a big, fun puzzle. You have to make sure your timing is just right to get to the next part. You have to reach the other side of things or escape rolling rocks or giant spiders. There are some parts where the game gives you no choices. Like when a brain sucking work infects you and you must find ways around it or to get it out. There are some things that havent been answered yet like why are all those people trying to kill you, or why can't you swim for more than 2 seconds.. Anyway, great game.


# Final Thoughts

I tried this game out because I had seen others play it and it looked good, plus I already had it installed so I went ahead and used it for this weeks game review. The controls are really easy to use and even without explanation or words, I was able to properly figure out what I needed to press to do stuff. This game had no cinematics, it was just a very simple black and white, no graphics kind of game. It sounds boring, but it's actually really addicting. I had alot of fun playing this and could definitly see myself finishing it all off in one night.
