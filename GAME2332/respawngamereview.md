* Game Title: Respawn


# Summary

This game is about a scientist who invents a re-spawn machine, and another scientist sends his minions to retrieve it. You play as the inventor and must run from the minions by jumping over buildings and facing lasers and other dangers. The re-spawn machine must be thrown to somewhere safe and then you must kill yourself to re-spawn to where the machine is.

# Final Thoughts

After getting used to the controls, it gets funner the further you play but it is a little repetitive (jump across buildings, kill yourself), and at some parts a little glitchy (getting stuck between objects, falling through floors) but overall, if I made this game, I would be proud.
